"""Test package initializer: configure environment to avoid native thread shutdown issues.

This file runs very early when pytest imports test modules as a package. It does NOT mock
any external libraries â€” it only sets environment variables to limit the number of threads
used by OpenMP/MKL/OpenBLAS/NumExpr and tries to reduce torch's threads if torch is already
installed. These measures reduce chances of segmentation faults caused by native thread
finalizers running at process exit.
